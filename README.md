# Overview
This project will consist of building a CI/CD Pipeline for the Agile Development in Azure course with Udacity. The project will be separated into two parts which will be Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. The first part will focus on CI development having subjects such as creating a Makefile, requirements, and application code, and setting up GitHub Actions. The second part will be focused on CD Development which integrates the CI part of the project with a Flask application and an Azure Pipeline. 

## Project Plan
The following links represent the first stage of the project focused on planning: 

* https://trello.com/invite/b/6dpE7Ttd/ATTI736305158d6306c7d13d79d4b517cebbA10946C3/ci-cd-pipeline-planning

## Instructions

<TODO:  
* Architectural Diagram (Shows how key parts of the system work)>

<TODO:  Instructions for running the Python project.  How could a user with no context run this project without asking you for any help.  Include screenshots with explicit steps to create that work. Be sure to at least include the following screenshots:

* Project running on Azure App Service

* Project cloned into Azure Cloud Shell

* Passing tests that are displayed after running the `make all` command from the `Makefile`

* Output of a test run

* Successful deploy of the project in Azure Pipelines.  [Note the official documentation should be referred to and double checked as you setup CI/CD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/ecosystems/python-webapp?view=azure-devops).

* Running Azure App Service from Azure Pipelines automatic deployment

* Successful prediction from deployed flask app in Azure Cloud Shell.  [Use this file as a template for the deployed prediction](https://github.com/udacity/nd082-Azure-Cloud-DevOps-Starter-Code/blob/master/C2-AgileDevelopmentwithAzure/project/starter_files/flask-sklearn/make_predict_azure_app.sh).
The output should look similar to this:

```bash
udacity@Azure:~$ ./make_predict_azure_app.sh
Port: 443
{"prediction":[20.35373177134412]}
```

* Output of streamed log files from deployed application
